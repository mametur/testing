## Lesson Plan

> during Sunday class
> - [Lesson Plan Slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/testing/week-1)

Learn some ways to use arrays:

- `for ... of` loops
- _mapping_: transform each entry in an array
- _filtering_: remove certain entries from an array
- _reducing_: combine all entries in an array
- _everying_: does each entry meet a certain criteria?

### Isolate

- `for ... of`: [examples](../isolate/for-of/examples), [exercises](../isolate/for-of/exercises)

### Integrate

Build a simple website that stores user input in an array.

The project this week is not collaborative.  You work together in your small groups, but should not be working on the same repository.

- [Week 1 in-class project](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/testing-integrate-week-1) (starter repo)

Helpful code to study:

- [User input in an array](../integrate/user-input-in-an-array.html)
- The `/example` directory in the project repo
